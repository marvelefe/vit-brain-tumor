# Vision Transformer for Tumor Classification

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Vision Transformer (ViT) model designed to classify tumor images into four categories. The model is trained on a custom dataset and demonstrates its capability to accurately differentiate between various tumor types using state-of-the-art transformer architecture.

## Project Overview
This project leverages the power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to classify medical images of tumors. The model is built using the `vit-pytorch` library, providing a robust architecture that captures complex patterns in medical imagery.

```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VIT-POC.git
    cd VIT-POC
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare the dataset**: 
   - Place your image dataset under the `./data/Training` and `./data/Testing` directories. 
   - Ensure the directory structure aligns with PyTorch's `ImageFolder` format.

## Training the Model

To train the model, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

Training progress, including loss and accuracy for both training and validation sets, will be displayed and saved as plots (`accuracy.png`, `loss.png`). The best-performing model is saved as `best_model.pth`.

## Evaluating the Model

During training, the model is evaluated against the validation dataset. Post-training, a confusion matrix is generated and saved as `confusion_matrix.png`, offering insights into the model's classification performance.

## Testing on a New Image

To classify a new image, use the `test.py` script:

```bash
python test.py
```

Replace the image path in the script with your target image. The model predicts the tumor class, and a confidence level is displayed along with a visual bar chart saved as `prediction_result.png`.

## Results

The model achieves competitive accuracy in classifying tumor images across four distinct classes. Performance metrics, including accuracy and loss plots, are available in the repository.
